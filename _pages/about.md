I am Ethan Chen, born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. I am currently pursuing my Master of Engineering in Operation Research (ORIE) with a concentration in Data Analytics at Cornell University. I also received my Bachelor's degree at Cornell, double majoring in Applied Economics & Management and Statistics. I hope to pursue a career in quantitative finance, where I strongly leverage my quantitative skills with my passion for financial markets and products.

Outside of academics, I am heavily involved on campus. I like to be physically active, where I am either working out or doing wushu, a performative-based Chinese martial arts. As such, I am the President of the Wushu Club at Cornell. In addition, I am involved with Cornell Dining as a Student Assistant Director, where I oversee the student operations of the ten units of Ag Quad. Lastly, I am also president of Cornell Actuarial Society.
