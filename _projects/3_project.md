We created an R Package with several functions that analyze, map, and predict national hurricane information. This package includes information on the packages needed to use ours as well as examples of each function. Lastly, there are statistical analyses performed on the dataset to show how our package can be used to enhance the data analysis of tropical cyclones. The link to the project can be found in repositories.
