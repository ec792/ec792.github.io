Past research has created a foundation for national-level sustainable indices in order to compare countries' commitments to sustainable tourism. However, these indices lose detail at the city level. In particular, we note that no sub-national sustainable tourism index exists. In this paper, we use indicators in the economic, social, environmental and policy categories to measure sustainable tourism across 50 U.S cities. These observations have important implications for policymakers and responsible tourists, while also promoting sustainability in host communities. The link to the project can be found in repositories.
